# 💼 Employee Salary Prediction ML Using Streamlit + ngrok

## 📌 Description
The project is focused on developing an **Employee Salary Prediction** application using machine learning techniques. It involves preprocessing demographic and employment data, applying models like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, and XGBoost, and comparing them based on evaluation metrics including ROC curves. The project emphasizes robust data preprocessing, especially handling categorical variables and scaling, combined with effective visualization of feature importances and model performance through consistent, well-styled charts. The solution is deployed as an interactive Streamlit app that allows both single and batch salary predictions, enhancing usability and practical application.

## 🚀 Features
- 📊 **Single Input Prediction**: Enter personal and employment details manually.  
- 📂 **Batch Prediction**: Upload a CSV file with multiple records for bulk predictions.  
- 🎯 **Probability Estimates**: Shows prediction confidence.  
- ⬇️ **Downloadable Results**: Batch predictions can be exported as CSV.  
- 🎨 **Modern UI**: Dark theme, styled components, balloons animation for success.  
- 🌍 **Public Web Access**: Deploys instantly with ngrok.
