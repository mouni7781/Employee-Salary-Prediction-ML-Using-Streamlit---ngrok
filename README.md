# Employee-Salary-Prediction-ML-Using-Streamlit-&-ngrok
The project is focused on developing an **Employee Salary Prediction** application using machine learning techniques. It involves preprocessing demographic and employment data, applying models like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, and XGBoost, and comparing them based on evaluation metrics including ROC curves. The project emphasizes robust data preprocessing, especially handling categorical variables and scaling, combined with effective visualization of feature importances and model performance through consistent, well-styled charts. The solution is deployed as an interactive Streamlit app that allows both single and batch salary predictions, enhancing usability and practical application.
